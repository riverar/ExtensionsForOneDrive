{"name":"Extensions for OneDrive","tagline":"Helpful extensions to augment OneDrive capabilities in Windows","body":"# Extensions for OneDrive\r\n\r\n## About\r\nExtensions for OneDrive currently adds:\r\n\r\n* A \"Copy OneDrive public link\" context menu item\r\n* A shell icon overlay to indicate state of cloud->local sync\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nSee [Releases](https://github.com/riverar/ExtensionsForOneDrive/releases) for downloadable bits.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPlace all bits into a permanent folder (e.g. `C:\\Program Files\\Extensions for OneDrive`) and execute `Install.bat` (as a user with administrative privileges).\r\n\r\nThis will register the shell extension and [ngen](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t9t5wcf.aspx) managed binaries for faster start up performance.\r\n\r\nRestart Windows (or the shell) for changes to take effect.\r\n\r\n## Uninstallation\r\n\r\nExecute `Uninstall.bat` (again, as a user with administrative privileges).\r\n\r\nThis will unregister the shell extension and remove any previously ngen'ed binaries.\r\n\r\nRestart Windows to ensure you can delete all bits from their permanent location.\r\n(You may instead resort to terminating and restarting all processes hosting the extension.)\r\n\r\n## Looking to contribute?\r\n\r\nI welcome everyone to peruse the code and suggest changes where needed.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, I'd like to:\r\n\r\n* Improve (un)installation workflow\r\n* Implement Clipboard-to-OneDrive to enable raw image data sharing scenarios\r\n* Add another overlay handler to indicate \"in the cloud\" state\r\n\t* Ideally by not eating another shell icon overlay slot\r\n* Clean up the service\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nPlease use the issue tracker to submit any problems you run into.
